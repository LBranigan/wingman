## 13. Known Issues & Limitations

### Status: ✅ NO CRITICAL ISSUES

#### Minor Observations (Non-blocking):
1. **No .env file check** - Assumed developers will create `.env` files
2. **No database migration check** - Assumed `prisma migrate` has been run
3. **No email verification** - Registration doesn't verify email addresses
4. **Partner matching is random** - No preference-based matching algorithm
5. **No pagination on current week goals** - Assumes users won't create 100+ goals/week
6. **No real-time updates** - Requires manual refresh to see partner changes
7. **No undo functionality** - Deleted goals are permanently removed
8. **Charts limited to 12 weeks** - Statistics page doesn't show full history

**Note:** All of the above are design decisions or future enhancements, not bugs.
