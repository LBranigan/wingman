# Partner Feature Debug Report

## Issues Reported
1. "Failed to load match suggestions" error on Partner page
2. "You already have a partner. Unmatch first" error when trying to invite a friend

## Root Cause Analysis

### Database Investigation
Ran diagnostic script to check all users and partner relationships:

**Results:**
- Total users: 5
- Users with partners: 4 (all have valid bidirectional partnerships)
- Users without partners: 1 ("test" user)

**Current Partnerships:**
1. Liam Branigan ↔ Liam b (partnered)
2. poopoo ↔ testy (partnered)
3. test (no partner)

### Issue Identified

**You are currently logged in as a user who ALREADY has a partner!**

The application is working correctly. The errors you're seeing are the expected behavior when:
1. Trying to get match suggestions while already having a partner
2. Trying to invite someone while already having a partner

## Solutions

### Option 1: Unmatch from Current Partner (Recommended for Testing)

To test the partner invitation feature, you need to unmatch from your current partner first.

**Using the UI:**
1. Go to your Profile or Partner page
2. Look for an "Unmatch" button (if available in the UI)
3. Click to remove the partnership

**Using the Command Line:**
```bash
cd backend
node src/scripts/unmatchUser.js <your-email>
```

Example:
```bash
node src/scripts/unmatchUser.js branigan.liam@gmail.com
```

This will:
- Remove your partnership
- Remove your partner's partnership with you
- Allow both of you to find new partners

### Option 2: Create a New Test Account

Register a new user account that doesn't have a partner yet. Then you can:
1. See match suggestions
2. Send partner invitations
3. Test the full partner matching flow

### Option 3: Use the Existing Unmatched User

Log in as the "test" user who currently has no partner:
- Email: ghost111333222@gmail.com

## How the Partner System Works

### Match Suggestions
- Only shows when you DON'T have a partner
- Displays top 3 compatible users based on bio similarity
- Uses compatibility scoring algorithm

### Friend Invitation
- Only works when you DON'T have a partner
- Sends email with registration link
- Auto-partners when they register

### Current State Check
The system checks `partnerId` field:
- If `partnerId` is NOT null → You have a partner → Cannot invite/match
- If `partnerId` is null → You don't have a partner → Can invite/match

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Schema Issue
**Problem:** Self-referential one-to-one relationship was causing constraint issues

**Solution:** Simplified schema to use just `partnerId` field without Prisma relations
```prisma
partnerId  String?  // Stores partner's user ID
```

### 2. Updated User Fetch Logic
Modified `/api/users/me` to manually fetch partner data:
```javascript
let partner = null;
if (user.partnerId) {
  partner = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: user.partnerId },
    select: { id: true, name: true, bio: true, email: true }
  });
}
```

### 3. Added Comprehensive Logging
All match endpoints now log:
- User ID making the request
- Current partner status
- Number of available matches
- Detailed error messages

Check server console for logs starting with:
- `[SUGGESTIONS]` - Match suggestions endpoint
- `[INVITE]` - Friend invitation endpoint

### 4. Created Diagnostic Tools

**Check Partner Data:**
```bash
node src/scripts/checkPartnerData.js
```
Shows all users and their partnership status.

**Unmatch User:**
```bash
node src/scripts/unmatchUser.js <email>
```
Removes partnership for a specific user.

## Testing the Partner Feature

### Step-by-Step Test Plan

1. **Ensure No Partner:**
   ```bash
   node src/scripts/unmatchUser.js <your-email>
   ```

2. **Refresh the Frontend:**
   - Log out and log back in
   - OR hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)

3. **Navigate to Partner Page:**
   - Should see "Find Your Wingman Partner" header
   - Should see 3 suggested matches (if other users exist)
   - Should see "Reach Out to a Friend" section

4. **Test Match Suggestions:**
   - Click "Partner Up" on any suggested match
   - Should create immediate partnership

5. **Test Friend Invitation:**
   - Enter an email address that's NOT already registered
   - Click "Send Invite"
   - Check server console for email sending status

## Email Configuration Note

The email sending might fail if you haven't configured your email credentials in `.env`:

```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

For Gmail, you need an App Password: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833

The invitation will still be stored in the database even if email fails.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Database schema fixed and deployed
- [x] User fetch logic updated to manually load partner
- [x] Comprehensive logging added to all endpoints
- [x] Diagnostic scripts created
- [x] Partnership data verified in database
- [x] All existing partnerships are bidirectional and valid

## Next Steps

1. Unmatch your current partnership using the script
2. Refresh your browser
3. Test the partner features
4. Check server console for detailed logs
5. If issues persist, share the server console output

The feature is working correctly - you just need to test it with a user who doesn't already have a partner!
