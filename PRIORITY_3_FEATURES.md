## 📚 Code Examples

### Using the History API:
```javascript
import { goals } from '../services/api';

// Get first page
const response = await goals.getHistory({
  page: 1,
  limit: 20
});

// Search for goals
const searchResults = await goals.getHistory({
  search: 'exercise',
  status: 'completed'
});

// Access data
const weeks = response.data.data;
const pagination = response.data.pagination;
```

### Using the Statistics API:
```javascript
import { goals } from '../services/api';

const response = await goals.getStatistics();
const stats = response.data;

console.log(stats.completionRate);  // 75
console.log(stats.currentStreak);   // 3
console.log(stats.weeklyData);      // Array of last 12 weeks
```

### Rendering a Chart:
```javascript
import { BarChart, Bar, XAxis, YAxis } from 'recharts';

<BarChart data={stats.weeklyData}>
  <XAxis dataKey="week" />
  <YAxis />
  <Bar dataKey="total" fill="#6366f1" />
  <Bar dataKey="completed" fill="#10b981" />
</BarChart>
```
