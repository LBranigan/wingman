# Partnership Request System Implementation

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Added `PartnershipRequest` model** with fields:
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `status`: "pending", "accepted", or "rejected"
  - `senderId`: User who sent the request
  - `receiverId`: User who received the request
  - `createdAt`, `updatedAt`: Timestamps
  - **Unique constraint**: Prevents duplicate requests between same users
  - **Index**: Fast lookups for receiver's pending requests

### 2. Backend API Endpoints

#### GET `/api/match/requests`
- Returns all pending partnership requests for the current user
- Includes both sent and received requests
- Includes full sender and receiver details

#### POST `/api/match/request`
- **CHANGED**: Now creates a partnership request instead of auto-matching
- Validates both users are available
- Prevents duplicate requests
- Returns request details

#### POST `/api/match/requests/:requestId/accept`
- **NEW**: Accept a partnership request
- Only the receiver can accept
- Creates mutual partnership (both users get partnerId set)
- Updates request status to "accepted"
- Returns partner details

#### POST `/api/match/requests/:requestId/reject`
- **NEW**: Reject a partnership request
- Only the receiver can reject
- Updates request status to "rejected"
- Request remains in database for history

### 3. Frontend Updates

#### PartnerPage UI
**When user has NO partner:**

1. **Partnership Requests Section** (New!)
   - Shows all pending requests
   - **Received requests**: Display with Accept/Reject buttons
   - **Sent requests**: Display as "Request pending..."
   - Each request shows:
     - User's name and bio
     - Clear indicator if you're the sender or receiver
     - Action buttons (only for received requests)

2. **Suggested Matches** (Updated)
   - "Partner Up" button now **sends a request** instead of auto-matching
   - Shows success message: "Partnership request sent! üì®"

3. **Invite a Friend**
   - Unchanged - still sends email invitations

**When user HAS a partner:**
- Shows partner card with goals
- Can add comments to partner's goals
- Unmatch button available

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Using Suggested Matches

1. **User A** sees User B in suggested matches
2. **User A** clicks "Partner Up" on User B's card
3. **System** creates a partnership request (status: pending)
4. **User A** sees "‚è≥ Request pending..." in requests section
5. **User B** sees "‚úâÔ∏è Wants to partner with you!" with Accept/Reject buttons
6. **User B** clicks "Accept"
7. **System** creates mutual partnership
8. **Both users** can now see each other's goals and add comments

### Scenario 2: Email Invitation

1. **User A** enters User C's email
2. **User C** receives email with registration link
3. **User C** registers using the link
4. **System** automatically creates mutual partnership
5. **Both users** immediately become partners (no request needed)

### Scenario 3: Rejecting a Request

1. **User D** sends request to User E
2. **User E** clicks "Reject"
3. **System** marks request as rejected
4. **User D** no longer sees the request in their list
5. **User E** can still see User D in suggested matches

## Mutual Goal Visibility & Chat

### Goal Visibility
Once partnered, **both users can**:
- See each other's current week goals
- View completion status
- See notes on goals

### Chat/Comments System
- Each user can **add comments** to their partner's goals
- Comments are visible to both users
- Comments show author name
- Sorted chronologically

**Example:**
- User A sets goal: "Run 5 miles"
- User B (partner) can click "+ add note" on User A's goal
- User B writes: "You got this! üí™"
- Comment appears on User A's goal with "User B" as author

## API Reference

### Match API (frontend/src/services/api.js)

```javascript
export const match = {
  getSuggestions: () => api.get('/match/suggestions'),
  request: (partnerId) => api.post('/match/request', { partnerId }),
  getRequests: () => api.get('/match/requests'),
  acceptRequest: (requestId) => api.post(`/match/requests/${requestId}/accept`),
  rejectRequest: (requestId) => api.post(`/match/requests/${requestId}/reject`),
  unmatch: () => api.post('/match/unmatch'),
  invite: (email) => api.post('/match/invite', { email })
};
```

## Testing the New System

### Test Scenario 1: Request Flow

1. **Create two test accounts** (or use existing ones)
2. **Unmatch** if already partnered
3. **User 1**: Go to Partner page
4. **User 1**: Click "Partner Up" on User 2's card
5. **User 1**: Should see "Request pending..." in requests section
6. **User 2**: Go to Partner page
7. **User 2**: Should see request with "Wants to partner with you!"
8. **User 2**: Click "Accept"
9. **Both users**: Should now see each other's goals

### Test Scenario 2: Rejection Flow

1. **User 1**: Send request to User 2
2. **User 2**: Click "Reject"
3. **User 2**: Request disappears from list
4. **User 1**: Request disappears from sent requests
5. **User 2**: Can still see User 1 in suggestions

### Test Scenario 3: Comments

1. **Ensure users are partnered**
2. **User 1**: Create a goal
3. **User 2**: Go to Partner page
4. **User 2**: Should see User 1's goal
5. **User 2**: Click "+ add note"
6. **User 2**: Enter comment and save
7. **User 1**: Refresh - should see comment from User 2

## Database Migration

The schema was updated with:
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

No manual SQL needed - Prisma handles it automatically.

## Breaking Changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The `/match/request` endpoint behavior changed:

**Before:**
- Immediately created mutual partnership
- Both users auto-matched

**After:**
- Creates a pending request
- Receiver must accept before partnership is created

**Migration for existing code:**
- If you have automated tests expecting instant matching, update them
- Email invitations still work the same (auto-match on registration)

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

Possible improvements:
- [ ] Notification system for new requests
- [ ] Request expiration (auto-reject after X days)
- [ ] Block user feature
- [ ] Request message/introduction
- [ ] Partnership history page
- [ ] Analytics (most common reject reasons, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

**"Partnership request already pending" error:**
- A request already exists between these users
- Check the Partnership Requests section

**Request not appearing:**
- Refresh the page
- Check backend console for errors
- Verify backend server is running

**Can't see partner's goals:**
- Ensure request was accepted (check database)
- Refresh user data
- Check that goals exist for current week

**Comments not showing:**
- Verify partnership exists (both users have partnerId set)
- Check goal belongs to partner
- Ensure comment was created successfully

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added PartnershipRequest model
- `src/routes/match.js` - Added request/accept/reject endpoints

### Frontend:
- `src/services/api.js` - Added new API methods
- `src/pages/PartnerPage.js` - Added request UI and handlers

### Scripts:
None - existing diagnostic scripts still work

## Summary

The partnership system now requires **mutual consent** before users can see each other's goals and communicate. This prevents unwanted partnerships and gives users control over who they partner with.

‚úÖ Both users must agree to partner
‚úÖ Clear UI for pending requests
‚úÖ Full goal visibility once partnered
‚úÖ Comment/chat system works for both partners
‚úÖ Email invitations still auto-match (convenience for friends)
