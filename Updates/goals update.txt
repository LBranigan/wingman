1) make sure the state is saved for the goals. When the final day (or any day after the final day) of the goal set is reached, the user should be prompted - "Goal Set Complete". This will provide an overview of the goals, and the user must choose whether the goal was completed (by checking it off), or migrate it to a new goal set. If migrating to a new goal set, that window will pop up after completing this first on.
2) There should be an option to create a print friendly PDF version of any goal set. This will automatically format the listed goals to fit on a single piece of paper (portrait style). The goals will be spaced evenly vertically with the same amount of margin space below each goal to fill up the page entirely. Do not allow 2 pages, try hard to format everything to fit on one page.
