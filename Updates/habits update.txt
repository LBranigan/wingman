1) when creating a new habit, have the icons be humorous but still minimalistic. Here are some examples: "anti-social media icon" that shows a 'facebook thumbs up' type icon with a big circle with a cross on it. there could also be an anti-phone icon, an anti-tv icon, a pro-workout icon. basically the icons should correlate to either humorously celebrate "good" habits or derisively celebrate the ending of a "bad" habit.
2) I don't want the habit collection to pulsate as you have it. It should simple exist and have a nice subtle dropshadow or other non-animated effect. As previously stated it should change colors over time and make the user aware of this (when they click to the habits page after the card has "promoted" the user should be made aware through a subtle animation changing the color.
