1. Instead of automatically matching, I want the app to find the top 3 most compatible matches at this time. By compatible, the app can "read" the users bio and try to match it with another. But the person should be given an option of 3 people to potentially reach out to.
2. There should be a prominent button that says "Reach out to a friend". when the user clicks this button, they are prompted to enter the email of a friend that might be interested in partnering with them. The user types that email into the prompt and that person is sent an email request saying 'this user would like to be a wingman with you, click here to set your goals and hold each other accountable.
